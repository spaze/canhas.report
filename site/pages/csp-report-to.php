	CSP is a policy that lets the authors (or server administrators) of a web application inform the browser about the sources from which the application expects to load resources like images, scripts, styles, or even where to submit forms.
	Content Security Policy is not intended as a first line of defense against content injection vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Instead, CSP is best used as defense-in-depth, to reduce the harm caused by content injection attacks. 
	The <code>report-to</code> directive using the Reporting API replaces the deprecated <code>report-uri</code> directive in Content Security Policy level 3 spec, which is not yet fully supported by all major clients.
	To support more browsers, apps usually send both <code>report-uri</code> and <code>report-to</code> in their CSP headers.';
